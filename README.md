# GLOFAIR

`GLOFAIR` is a a methodology that exploits Multi-Objective Optimization to mitigate unfair behavior of the models learned in the federation by both maximizing predictive performance and satisfying a set of fairness constraints.
Unlike many existing methods in the literature, which typically address a single fairness metric or sensitive attribute at a
time, `GLOFAIR` accommodates multiple fairness constraints simultaneously differing in terms of fairness metrics and sensitive attributes.
